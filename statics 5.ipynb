    "1. Let's consider an example using a fair coin. Define the events A, B, and C as follows:\n",

    "The events are pairwise independent. However, when we consider all three events, they are not independent:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(A ∩ B ∩ C) = 0\n",

    "This is because if A and B both occur (i.e., both tosses are heads), then there are 2 heads, which contradicts event C (an even number of heads). \n",
