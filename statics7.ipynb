    "To calculate the probability that the email is spam given that it mentions \"free money,\" we can use Bayes' theorem. Let S be the event that an email is spam and F be the event that the email contains the phrase \"free money.\" We want to find P(S | F).\n",

    "We are given the following probabilities:\n",
    "P(S) = 0.8 (80% of emails are spam)\n",
    "P(F | S) = 0.1 (10% of spam emails contain \"free money\")\n",
    "P(F | Sᶜ) = 0.01 (1% of non-spam emails contain \"free money\")\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need to find the probability of F:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(F) = P(F | S) * P(S) + P(F | Sᶜ) * P(Sᶜ)\n",
    "P(F) = 0.1 * 0.8 + 0.01 * 0.2\n",
    "P(F) = 0.08 + 0.002 = 0.082\n",

    "Now we can apply Bayes' theorem to find P(S | F):\n",

    "P(S | F) = P(F | S) * P(S) / P(F)\n",
    "P(S | F) = (0.1 * 0.8) / 0.082\n",
    "P(S | F) ≈ 0.9756\n",

    "So, given that the email mentions \"free money,\" there is approximately a 97.56% chance that it is spam."
