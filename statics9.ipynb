    "We are given the following probabilities:\n",

    "(a) To find the probability of winning the first game, we can use the law of total probability:\n",

    "P(Win2 and Win1) = (0.8 * 0.8 * 1/3) + (0.6 * 0.6 * 1/3) + (0.4 * 0.4 * 1/3)\n",

    "(c) The distinction between assuming that the outcomes of the games are independent and assuming that they are conditionally independent given the opponent's skill level is important. If the outcomes are independent, it means that the result of one game does not affect the result of the other game in any way. However, if they are conditionally independent given the opponent's skill level, it means that the outcomes are independent when considering the skill level of the opponent.\n",

    "Assuming conditional independence given the opponent's skill level is more reasonable because the results of the games are likely to be correlated to the skill level of the opponent. If you win the first game, it might be an indication that the opponent is not very skilled, which would increase your chances of winning the second game."
